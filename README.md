# 🚨 SentinelAI - AI-Powered Emergency Prioritization & Response System

> "SentinelAI transforms emergency response by using AI-driven triage, intelligent prioritization, and real-time geospatial awareness to ensure critical incidents receive immediate attention." 🚨

An intelligent emergency response platform that receives SOS requests, uses AI to assess severity, assigns priority scores, and visualizes incidents on a real-time map to help emergency operators respond faster and more effectively.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Emergency services often receive hundreds of SOS requests simultaneously during accidents, crimes, medical emergencies, disasters, and women's safety incidents. Current systems rely heavily on manual triage, causing:

* Delayed response times
* Misprioritized incidents
* Resource inefficiencies
* Lack of real-time situational awareness
* Critical emergencies remaining unattended while less severe cases are processed

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

SentinelAI autonomously streamlines the emergency intake process. The system receives SOS reports, analyzes the reports using AI, assigns a priority score, and classifies the emergency type. It then displays incidents on a live map, sorts emergencies by urgency, and assists operators in crucial decision-making.

---

## ⭐ Key Features

* **AI Emergency Triage:** Analyzes text reports, images, and location data to output a priority score, severity level, and emergency type.
* **Priority Dashboard:** Operators can view all incidents, sort by priority, filter by emergency type, and monitor live statistics.
* **AI Image Analysis:** Detects vehicle accidents, fires, violence indicators, and crowd incidents.
* **Women Safety Fast Track:** AI automatically boosts priority if distress keywords are detected, the emergency occurs late at night, or the SOS suggests personal danger.
* **Fake SOS Detection (Future):** Identifies spam reports, duplicate incidents, and suspicious submissions.

### Real-Time Emergency Map

Displays incidents using color-coded markers based on urgency:

| Priority | Color |
| :--- | :--- |
| Critical | 🔴 Red |
| High | 🟠 Orange |
| Medium | 🟡 Yellow |
| Low | 🟢 Green |

## 🏗 System Architecture

| Stage | Component | Action / Data Handled |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | 👤 **Citizen** | Triggers emergency SOS alert. |
| **2** | 📱 **Client App** | Captures `Text Description`, `Image`, & `GPS Location`. |
| **3** | ⚙️ **Backend API** | Receives and authenticates the emergency payload. |
| **4** | 🧠 **Gemini AI** | Analyzes context ➔ Generates `Priority Score` & `Severity`. |
| **5** | 🗄️ **Database** | Stores incident securely as a document. |
| **6** | 🖥️ **Operator UI** | Dispatches real-time updates to **Dashboard** and **Live Map**. |

## 👥 User Roles

**Citizen**
* Submit SOS
* Upload image
* Share location

**Operator / Admin**
* View incidents
* Monitor emergency map
* Filter incidents
* Update status

---

## 📋 Product Requirements

### SOS Submission
Users can submit their emergency type, a brief description, their live location (latitude/longitude), and an image of the incident.

### AI Analysis
The system generates a Priority Score (0-100), a Severity Level, and an Emergency Type.

### Dashboard & Map
The system displays an incident list with priority ranking, filters, and statistics. It also plots incidents on a live map that updates in real-time.
